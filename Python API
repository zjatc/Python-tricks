*Use start.sh instead of supervisord
The trick is to change few parameters on gunicorn_conf.py as below (example):
workers = 5
bind = '0.0.0.0:8080'    # change to 8080 if deploy to K8S
reload = False
daemon = False           # this must be set as false or docker will treat process dies
timeout = 30
preload_app = True
threads = 4
pidfile = 'gunicorn.pid'
accesslog = '-'              # write guicorn logs to stdout when deploy to K8S
errorlog = '-'                # write guicorn logs to stdout when deploy to K8S
